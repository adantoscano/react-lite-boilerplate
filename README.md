# simply-react

Just another react boilerplate intending to be easily understandable.

## How to use

`npx simply-react new`

and follow the instructions.

## What we'll get

A ready to dev and customize React and webpack 4 stack.

## React?

If you are here you should know what react is...

## Webpack?

Ok, this may is more tricky to understand...
I will develop a quick guide about this webpack config in the future(soon).

## Why do not use create-react-app?

I said that? The oficial solution is a really great way to start a project, but maybe not that great when you try to understand how is webpack working with react and maybe you would not miss some of webpack benefits.
